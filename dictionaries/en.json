      "I believe that when we initiate the psychoanalytical process, we start a personal journey. There are many times when we have experienced disrupting situations. Talking about these moments can be hard, especially when you connect with your own grief and you don't feel prepared to confront it. Through this in company is an option which give to you intimacy and a deeply knowledge about how figure out your present life.",
      "I believe that in our life we can go through painful situations, abrupt changes, vital crises, and traumatic experiences, amongst other things. Situations like this are difficult to think about, and especially difficult to talk about. Psychoanalysis is a journey that allows us to think through our mental hardships and transform them into an experience of personal development."

        "Psychoanalysis is a method that allows us to have a deep understanding of ourselves and of our own suffering. Throughout our lives we have distinct experiences which leave their mark on us. We are able to resolve some, but for others we can’t seem to find the answers. Psychoanalysis give us the tools to dive deeply into the most difficult of these experiences. Using methods of free-association and dreamwork to reach unconscious aspects, which in many cases express themselves without us being able to make sense of them. Psychoanalysis requires constant work. Meeting together multiple times per week is characteristic of this work. There is a compromise with oneself and with the process. "
